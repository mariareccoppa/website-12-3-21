          <p>
            Hello! I am Maria. I am a Japanese 19 year old hoping to make an
            excellent website! I am a full-time sophomore currently studying
            Computer Information Sytsems at Molloy College!

          <p>
            Coding has taught me to continue pushing through my problems no
            matter what. There is always a solution for everything!
